# Funny loops

This game was made in 96 hours for GMTK 2025 Game Jam (Theme: Loop).

Try it out now over at https://yurcheeg.itch.io/funny-loops

Your goal is to get the "funny loop" to the bowl by drawing a line towards it.

The jam version includes a one significant bug and random texture glitches. They were fixed, but I can't upload the changes as it would disqualify the game from the game jam.

Most of the art is made by @MaxMezeria
